                  <i>magi</i>;
                  also verses 7, 16 from the east came to Jerusalem,<span class="verse-num">2</span>saying, "Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it roseOr
                  <i>in the east</i>;
                  also verse 9 and have come to worship him."<span class="verse-num">3</span>When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;<span class="verse-num">4</span>and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.<span class="verse-num">5</span>They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:
                </p>
                <p class="line-group">

                <p><span class="verse-num">7</span>Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared.<span class="verse-num">8</span>And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him."

And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was.<span class="verse-num">10</span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.<span class="verse-num">11</span>And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.<span class="verse-num">12</span>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.
